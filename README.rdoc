= Introduction

GreenCloth is derived from RedCloth, the defacto text to html converter for ruby.

The purpose of GreenCloth is to add a bunch of new features to RedCloth that make
it more suited for wiki markup.

GreenCloth requires that RedCloth version > 4.0 is installed and that prior
versions are NOT installed.

= Changes from RedCloth

New markup:

* Crabgrass style links [my blog post -> meblogpretty.org/2008/4/5]
* Autolinks
* Additional way to specify code blocks
* Markdown blockquotes (>)
* Setext headers (h1 is formed by under line with ====, h2 underline with ----)
* Allow embedded video tags, and sanitize these embeds.
* Tables can use tabs in addition to pipes (|)
* Insert table of contents with [[toc]]
* Add unique clickable anchors to each heading (if to_html is passed option :outline)
* Pass an optional callback block for rendering links (allows for dead link rendering)

= Usage

== Example usage

You can use greencloth like so:

  greencloth = GreenCloth.new(body, context_name, [:outline])
  greencloth.to_html

Greencloth.new takes three argument:

* The raw greencloth markup text
* The context name for resolving links. The path for links are prefixed with this context.
* an array of greencloth options. useful options include:
  * +:outline+ -- turn on the generation of outline data and markup.
  * +:lite_mode+ -- disable blocks, only allow some markup.

== Passing a block to to_html()

Greencloth.to_html can take a block. The block is passed data regarding every link
that it encounteres while processing links.

You can use this to do custom rendering of links. For example:

  html = GreenCloth.new(test_text,'mygroup').to_html() do |link_data|
    process_link(link_data)
  end

+process_link+ should return either nil or an <a> tag. If nil, then the greencloth
default is used.

link_date is a hash that might include: url, label, context_name, page_name

= Testing

To run the all the tests:

  rake test

Or to test the markup from a specific fixture:

  ruby test/markup_test.rb test/fixtures/images.yml


== TODO

sometimes the header detection for editing inline fails.
